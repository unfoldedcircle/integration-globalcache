# Contributing

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

Found a bug, typo, missing feature or a description that doesn't make sense or needs clarification?  
Great, please let us know!

### Bug Reports :bug:

If you find a bug, please search for it first in the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/unfoldedcircle/integration-globalcache/issues),
and if it isn't already tracked, [create a new issue](https://github.com/unfoldedcircle/integration-globalcache/issues/new).

### Pull Requests

**Any pull request needs to be reviewed and approved by the Unfolded Circle development team.**

We love contributions from everyone.

⚠️ If you plan to make substantial changes, we kindly ask you, that you please reach out to us first.  
Either by opening a feature request describing your proposed changes before submitting code, or by contacting us on
one of the other [feedback channels](#feedback-speech_balloon).

Since this software (or part of it) is being used on the embedded Remote Two device, we have to make sure it remains
compatible with the embedded runtime environment and runs smoothly.

With that out of the way, here's the process of creating a pull request and making sure it passes the automated tests:

### Contributing Code :bulb:

1. Fork the repo.

2. Make your changes or enhancements (preferably on a feature-branch).

   Contributed code must be licensed under the Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0).  
   It is required to add a boilerplate copyright notice to the top of each file:

    ```
    /**
     * {Short description what this file is for}
     *
     * @copyright (c) {year} {person OR org} <{email}>
     * @license Mozilla Public License Version 2.0, see LICENSE for more details.
     */
    ```

3. Make sure your changes follow the configured prettier code style:
    ```shell
    npm run format
    ```

4. Make sure your changes make the lints pass:
    ```shell
    npm run lint
    ```

5. Push to your fork.

6. Submit a pull request.

At this point we will review the PR and give constructive feedback.  
This is a time for discussion and improvements, and making the necessary changes will be required before we can
merge the contribution.
